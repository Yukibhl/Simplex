# Simplex by Yukibhl
Linear programming solution 
An example of linear problem :

  Maxz= x1+2x2
  where
  x1+3x2<=6
  2x1+x2<=3
  x1,x2>=0
 To solve this problem using simplex method you need to input these informations
 You will see on your screen :
    Maxz :1 2 
    Number of inequaities : 2
    Matrix b :6 3
    Inequality n 1:1 3
    Inequality n 2:2 1
    Only one optimal solution :
     x1= 1.8
     x2= 0.6
    Z optimal= 4.199999999999999
You need to put a space between two consecutif numbers
